  }

  # Developer access with environment restrictions
  allow if {
      "developers" in token[2].groups
      input.attributes.request.http.path != "/admin"
      environment_access_allowed
  }

  # Environment-based access control
  environment_access_allowed if {
      token[2].environment == "development"
  }

  environment_access_allowed if {
      token[2].environment == "staging"
      token[2].exp > time.now_ns() / 1000000000
      "senior-developers" in token[2].groups
  }

  # Resource-specific access control
  allow if {
      startswith(input.attributes.request.http.path, "/api/v1/resources/")
      resource_id := split(input.attributes.request.http.path, "/")[4]
      resource_access_allowed(resource_id)
  }

  resource_access_allowed(resource_id) if {
      resource_id in token[2].accessible_resources
  }

  # Time-based access control

## 10. Zero-Downtime IDP Operations and Rolling Upgrades

### Task Overview

Implement a comprehensive zero-downtime operations framework that allows individual IDP components to be updated, upgraded, and configured without affecting other services or requiring full platform restarts. This ensures continuous availability and eliminates the operational burden of coordinated downtime windows.

### Current State

- Configuration changes require full IDP restart or significant service disruption
- Monolithic deployment approach where components are tightly coupled
- No isolation between component updates and platform availability
- Manual coordination required for any platform changes or upgrades

### Requirements

#### 10.1 Component Isolation and Dependency Management

- **Objective**: Architect IDP components with clear boundaries and minimal interdependencies to enable independent updates
- **Component Isolation Strategy**:

  ```
  IDP Component Architecture (Loosely Coupled):

  ├── Core Infrastructure Layer (Stable, Rare Updates)
  │   ├── Kubernetes Cluster
  │   ├── Istio Service Mesh (Control Plane)
  │   └── External Secrets Operator
  │
  ├── Platform Services Layer (Independent Updates)
  │   ├── ArgoCD (GitOps Engine)
  │   ├── Crossplane (Infrastructure Management)
  │   ├── Monitoring Stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
  │   └── Security Services (OPA, Falco)
  │
  ├── Developer Experience Layer (Frequent Updates)
  │   ├── Backstage (Developer Portal)
  │   ├── Configuration Management Service
  │   └── Policy Management Interface
  │
  └── Application Workloads (Independent Lifecycle)
      ├── User Applications
      ├── Custom CRDs and Operators
      └── External Integrations
  ```

- **Dependency Mapping and Isolation**:

  ```yaml
  # Component Dependency Matrix
  apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
  kind: ComponentDependencyMap
  metadata:
    name: idp-component-dependencies
  spec:
    components:
      - name: backstage
        dependencies:
          hard: ['kubernetes-api', 'postgresql']
          soft: ['argocd-api', 'grafana-api']
          optional: ['external-secrets']
        updateStrategy: 'rolling'
        healthCheck: '/api/health'

      - name: argocd
        dependencies:
          hard: ['kubernetes-api', 'git-repositories']
          soft: ['backstage-webhooks']
          optional: ['monitoring-stack']
        updateStrategy: 'blue-green'
        healthCheck: '/api/v1/health'

      - name: crossplane
        dependencies:
          hard: ['kubernetes-api']
          soft: ['external-secrets']
          optional: ['monitoring-stack']
