## Task Structure for Claude Code

Each implementation task follows this standardized format:

````markdown
## Task: [Component Name] Implementation

### Context

- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Estimated Time**: X hours
- **Dependencies**: [List of prerequisite tasks]
- **Files to Create**: [List of new files]
- **Files to Update**: [List of existing files to modify]

### Prerequisites Check

```bash
# Commands to verify prerequisites
kubectl cluster-info
helm version
istioctl version
```
````

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Create Base Configuration

```yaml
# File: infrastructure/component/base-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: component-config
  namespace: platform
data:
  config.yaml: |
    # Complete configuration here
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Component

```bash
# Deployment commands
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/component/
helm upgrade component ./charts/component -f values.yaml
```

#### Step 3: Validation

```bash
# Validation commands
kubectl get pods -n platform
curl -f http://component:8080/health
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All pods are running and ready
- [ ] Health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show green status

### Rollback Plan

```bash
# Emergency rollback commands
helm rollback component
kubectl delete -f infrastructure/component/
```

### Next Steps

- Link to dependent tasks
- Configuration options for next phase
- Documentation updates required

## Claude Code Integration Features

### Automated Task Validation
Each task includes automated validation scripts that Claude Code can execute:

```bash
# Task validation script template
#!/bin/bash
set -e

TASK_NAME="$1"
IMPLEMENTATION_DIR="/Users/ayan/Desktop/Work/vscode/idp/implementation"

echo "Validating task: $TASK_NAME"

# Check file creation
for file in $(cat "docs/tasks/$TASK_NAME/required-files.txt"); do
    if [ ! -f "$IMPLEMENTATION_DIR/$file" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Required file missing: $file"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Run health checks
kubectl get pods -A | grep -E "(Error|CrashLoopBackOff|Pending)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Some pods are not healthy"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Task validation successful: $TASK_NAME"
````

### Progress Tracking

Claude Code can update implementation progress automatically:

```yaml
# implementation-progress.yaml
apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
kind: ImplementationProgress
metadata:
  name: idp-implementation-status
spec:
  startDate: '2025-08-03'
  phases:
    core-infrastructure:
      status: 'completed'
      completedTasks:
        - 'kubernetes-cluster-setup'
        - 'istio-installation'
        - 'argocd-deployment'
      remainingTasks: []
      completionDate: '2025-08-15'

    authentication-security:
      status: 'in-progress'
      completedTasks:
        - 'aws-cognito-setup'
      remainingTasks:
        - 'opa-integration'
        - 'service-mesh-policies'
      estimatedCompletion: '2025-08-29'
```

## Organizational Adoption Quick Start

### 30-Minute Quick Start for Organizations

```bash
# Quick organizational setup script
./scripts/organizational-quick-start.sh \
  --aws-org-id "o-1234567890" \
  --discovery-role "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/IDPDiscoveryRole" \
  --environment "development" \
  --template "microservices-per-account"
```

This script will:

1. Discover your AWS organization structure
2. Generate IDP configuration for your accounts
3. Deploy development IDP instance
4. Create sample applications for each discovered service
5. Set up basic monitoring and documentation

### Migration Checklist for Organizations

- [ ] **Week 1**: AWS organization discovery and IDP configuration generation
- [ ] **Week 2**: Development IDP deployment and testing with pilot service
- [ ] **Week 3**: Team training and documentation review
- [ ] **Week 4**: Staging IDP deployment and production planning
- [ ] **Week 5-8**: Gradual migration of services to IDP platform

## Ready-to-Use Templates

### Multi-Account Service Template

For your current organization structure where each service has its own AWS account:

```yaml
# Template: Service per AWS Account
apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
kind: OrganizationalTemplate
metadata:
  name: service-per-account-template
spec:
  description: 'Template for organizations with one AWS account per service'
  structure:
    accounts:
      user-service:
        awsAccountId: '123456789012'
        applications:
          - name: 'user-api'
            type: 'backend-api'
            infrastructure: ['ecs', 'rds', 'elasticache']
          - name: 'user-web'
            type: 'frontend'
            infrastructure: ['cloudfront', 's3', 'lambda']
      payment-service:
        awsAccountId: '123456789013'
        applications:
          - name: 'payment-api'
            type: 'backend-api'
            infrastructure: ['ecs', 'rds', 'sqs']

  crossplane:
    providerStrategy: 'account-specific'
    compositions:
      - 'service-ecs-cluster'
      - 'service-database'
      - 'service-cache'

  backstage:
    catalogStructure: 'service-based'
    rbacStrategy: 'service-ownership'
```

## Getting Started with Your Organization

Based on your AWS multi-account service architecture, here's the recommended approach:

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning (Week 1)

1. Run AWS organization discovery tool
2. Review generated IDP configuration
3. Select pilot service for initial migration
4. Set up development IDP instance

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (Weeks 2-3)

1. Deploy IDP for pilot service account
2. Migrate one application to IDP
3. Train pilot team on IDP workflows
4. Validate deployment and monitoring

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Weeks 4-8)

1. Deploy IDP instances for each service account
2. Migrate applications service by service
3. Train teams on IDP usage
4. Establish operational procedures

This approach minimizes risk and allows your organization to adopt the IDP gradually while maintaining existing workflows.
