# Organizational Migration Guide: AWS Multi-Account to IDP Platform

## Executive Summary

This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for migrating organizations with AWS multi-account service architectures to the IDP platform. The approach minimizes disruption while providing immediate value and gradual adoption.

## Your Current Architecture Analysis

Based on your description: "Each service has multiple applications and each application can have multiple AWS components", here's how the IDP platform maps to your structure:

### Current State Mapping

```
Your Current Organization:
├── Service A (AWS Account: 123456789012)
│   ├── Application A1 (ECS + RDS + ElastiCache)
│   ├── Application A2 (Lambda + DynamoDB + SQS)
│   └── Application A3 (EC2 + RDS + S3)
├── Service B (AWS Account: 123456789013)
│   ├── Application B1 (EKS + RDS + Redis)
│   └── Application B2 (Fargate + Aurora + CloudFront)
└── Service C (AWS Account: 123456789014)
    ├── Application C1 (ECS + PostgreSQL + ElastiCache)
    └── Application C2 (Lambda + DynamoDB + API Gateway)

IDP Platform Mapping:
├── IDP Instance per Service (or shared based on your preference)
│   ├── Service A IDP → Applications A1, A2, A3
│   ├── Service B IDP → Applications B1, B2
│   └── Service C IDP → Applications C1, C2
├── Crossplane Providers → One per AWS Account
├── Backstage Catalog → Service and Application visibility
└── Istio Service Mesh → Inter-application communication
```

## Migration Strategy Options

### Option 1: Service-Scoped IDP (Recommended for Your Structure)

**Best for**: Organizations with clear service boundaries and autonomous teams

```yaml
# Each service gets its own IDP instance
Service A Team:
  - IDP Instance: service-a.idp.company.com
  - AWS Account: 123456789012
  - Applications: A1, A2, A3
  - Team autonomy: Full control over deployments

Service B Team:
  - IDP Instance: service-b.idp.company.com
  - AWS Account: 123456789013
  - Applications: B1, B2
  - Team autonomy: Full control over deployments
```

**Pros**:

- ✅ Teams maintain autonomy
- ✅ No cross-team coordination needed
- ✅ Faster migration (service by service)
- ✅ Reduced blast radius for issues

**Cons**:

- ❌ Multiple IDP instances to manage
- ❌ Cross-service communication requires setup

### Option 2: Shared IDP with Service Isolation

**Best for**: Organizations wanting centralized platform management

```yaml
# Single IDP with service namespaces
Shared IDP Instance: platform.idp.company.com
├── service-a namespace → Applications A1, A2, A3
├── service-b namespace → Applications B1, B2
└── service-c namespace → Applications C1, C2

# Service-specific AWS account integration
Crossplane Providers:
  - service-a-provider → AWS Account 123456789012
  - service-b-provider → AWS Account 123456789013
  - service-c-provider → AWS Account 123456789014
```

**Pros**:

- ✅ Centralized platform management
- ✅ Easier cross-service communication
- ✅ Shared monitoring and observability
- ✅ Simplified platform updates

**Cons**:

- ❌ Requires coordination for platform changes
- ❌ Potential noisy neighbor issues

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

**Best for**: Large organizations with mixed requirements

```yaml
# Development/Staging: Shared IDP
development.idp.company.com
├── All services in development
└── Shared resources and rapid iteration

# Production: Service-Scoped IDPs
service-a-prod.idp.company.com → Service A Production
service-b-prod.idp.company.com → Service B Production
service-c-prod.idp.company.com → Service C Production
```

## Step-by-Step Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation and Pilot (Weeks 1-2)

#### Week 1: Discovery and Planning

1. **Automated Discovery**:

   ```bash
   # Run organizational discovery
   ./scripts/organizational-quick-start.sh \
     --aws-org-id your-org-id \
     --discovery-role arn:aws:iam::management-account:role/IDPDiscoveryRole \
     --dry-run
   ```

2. **Select Pilot Service**:
   Choose a service with:

   - ✅ Non-critical applications
   - ✅ 1-2 simple applications
   - ✅ Enthusiastic team
   - ✅ Clear service boundaries

3. **Infrastructure Preparation**:
   ```bash
   # Set up Kubernetes cluster for pilot
   # Configure basic IDP components
   # Set up monitoring and logging
   ```

#### Week 2: Pilot Implementation

1. **Deploy Pilot IDP**:

   ```bash
   # Deploy IDP for pilot service
   ./scripts/organizational-quick-start.sh \
     --aws-org-id your-org-id \
     --discovery-role arn:aws:iam::pilot-account:role/IDPDiscoveryRole \
     --environment development \
     --template microservices-per-account
   ```

2. **Migrate One Application**:

   ```yaml
   # Example: Migrate a simple web application
   apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
   kind: WebApplication
   metadata:
     name: pilot-app
     namespace: pilot-service
   spec:
     image: your-registry/pilot-app:latest
     replicas: 2
     environment: development
     infrastructure:
       database:
         type: postgresql
         size: small
       cache:
         type: redis
         size: small
   ```

3. **Team Training**:
   - Onboarding sessions using [New Engineer Guide](./onboarding/NEW_ENGINEER_GUIDE.md)
   - Hands-on workshops
   - Documentation review

### Phase 2: Pilot Validation and Iteration (Weeks 3-4)

#### Week 3: Pilot Testing and Feedback

1. **Application Migration Testing**:

   ```bash
   # Test application functionality
   # Validate monitoring and alerting
   # Test CI/CD integration
   # Performance testing
   ```

2. **Team Feedback Collection**:
   - Developer experience survey
   - Operational complexity assessment
   - Performance comparison
   - Security validation

#### Week 4: Pilot Optimization

1. **Address Feedback**:

   - Fix identified issues
   - Optimize configurations
   - Improve documentation
   - Enhance automation

2. **Prepare for Scale**:
   - Document lessons learned
   - Create standard procedures
   - Develop training materials
   - Plan rollout strategy

### Phase 3: Gradual Service Migration (Weeks 5-12)

#### Service Migration Template

For each service, follow this pattern:

```bash
# Week N: Service X Preparation
# 1. Infrastructure setup
kubectl create namespace service-x
./scripts/setup-service-infrastructure.sh --service service-x --aws-account 123456789xxx

# 2. Crossplane provider configuration
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/crossplane/providers/service-x-provider.yaml

# 3. Team preparation
# Run training sessions
# Set up development environment
# Configure CI/CD pipelines

# Week N+1: Service X Migration
# 1. Migrate non-critical applications first
kubectl apply -f applications/service-x/non-critical-apps/

# 2. Validate and monitor
idp-cli health-check --service service-x
kubectl get webapplications -n service-x

# 3. Migrate critical applications
kubectl apply -f applications/service-x/critical-apps/

# Week N+2: Service X Optimization
# 1. Performance tuning
# 2. Security hardening
# 3. Team feedback and improvements
```

#### Migration Schedule (Example for 5 Services)

| Week  | Activity            | Service               | Focus                         |
| ----- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 5-6   | Service A Migration | User Management       | Basic web applications        |
| 7-8   | Service B Migration | Payment Service       | API services with databases   |
| 9-10  | Service C Migration | Notification Service  | Event-driven architecture     |
| 11-12 | Service D & E       | Analytics & Reporting | Data pipelines and batch jobs |

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Weeks 13-16)

#### Week 13-14: Production Infrastructure

1. **Production IDP Setup**:

   ```bash
   # Deploy production-grade infrastructure
   ./scripts/deploy-production-idp.sh \
     --environment production \
     --high-availability \
     --security-hardened \
     --backup-enabled
   ```

2. **Security Hardening**:
   - Enable all security features
   - Configure compliance scanning
   - Set up audit logging
   - Implement access controls

#### Week 15-16: Production Migration

1. **Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**:
   ```yaml
   # Gradually shift traffic from old infrastructure to IDP
   migration:
     strategy: blue-green
     traffic_split:
       week_15: { old: 80%, idp: 20% }
       week_16: { old: 50%, idp: 50% }
       week_17: { old: 20%, idp: 80% }
       week_18: { old: 0%, idp: 100% }
   ```

## Integration Patterns for Your Architecture

### Application Type Mapping

#### ECS/Fargate Applications → WebApplication CRD

```yaml
# Your current ECS service becomes:
apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
kind: WebApplication
metadata:
  name: user-api
  namespace: user-service
spec:
  image: your-ecr/user-api:latest
  replicas: 3
  resources:
    requests: { cpu: '500m', memory: '1Gi' }
    limits: { cpu: '1', memory: '2Gi' }
  infrastructure:
    database:
      type: postgresql
      instance: db.t3.large
    cache:
      type: elasticache-redis
      nodes: 2
```

#### Lambda Functions → Knative/KEDA Integration

```yaml
# Your Lambda functions become:
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: payment-processor
  namespace: payment-service
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: '0'
        autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: '100'
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: your-ecr/payment-processor:latest
          env:
            - name: AWS_ACCOUNT
              value: '123456789013'
```

#### Databases → Crossplane Compositions

```yaml
# Your RDS instances become:
apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
kind: DatabaseInstance
metadata:
  name: user-database
  namespace: user-service
spec:
  engine: postgresql
  engineVersion: '13.7'
  instanceClass: db.t3.large
  allocatedStorage: 100
  providerConfigRef:
    name: user-service-provider
```

### Cross-Service Communication

```yaml
# Configure service mesh policies for your services
apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceCommunicationPolicy
metadata:
  name: payment-to-user-service
spec:
  source:
    service: payment-service
    namespace: payment-service
  destinations:
    - service: user-api
      namespace: user-service
      ports: [8080]
      methods: ['GET', 'POST']
  security:
    authentication: required
    authorization: jwt-claims
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

1. **Network Connectivity Issues**:

   ```bash
   # Pre-migration network validation
   ./scripts/validate-network-connectivity.sh --source-account xxx --target-cluster yyy
   ```

2. **Data Migration Risks**:

   ```bash
   # Database migration with rollback capability
   ./scripts/migrate-database.sh --source rds-instance --target crossplane-db --dry-run
   ```

3. **Performance Degradation**:
   ```yaml
   # Continuous performance monitoring during migration
   monitoring:
     sla_targets:
       response_time_p95: '< 500ms'
       availability: '> 99.9%'
       error_rate: '< 0.1%'
   ```

### Organizational Risks

1. **Team Resistance**:

   - Comprehensive training program
   - Show immediate value with pilot
   - Gradual learning curve
   - 24/7 support during migration

2. **Skill Gap**:

   - Role-based learning paths
   - Pair programming sessions
   - Documentation and runbooks
   - External training if needed

3. **Operational Complexity**:
   - Start with simple use cases
   - Automate everything possible
   - Clear escalation procedures
   - Rollback plans for every step
