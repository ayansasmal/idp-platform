## Interactive Learning Environment

### ðŸŽ¯ Hands-On Lab Environment

We provide a sandbox environment where you can safely experiment:

```bash
# Start your personal learning environment
./scripts/start-learning-environment.sh --user $USER

# Access your sandbox
open http://$USER-sandbox.idp.local
```

This gives you:

- Personal Backstage instance
- Sample applications to experiment with
- Pre-configured monitoring dashboards
- Safe environment to break things and learn

### ðŸ“š Progressive Learning Modules

Each module builds on the previous one:

#### Module 1: Deploy Your First Application (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Get a working application deployed and accessible

```yaml
# You'll create this simple configuration
apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
kind: WebApplication
metadata:
  name: my-first-app
spec:
  image: nginx:latest
  replicas: 2
  environment: development
```

**What you'll learn**:

- How to use the WebApplication CRD
- How Istio routing works
- How to access your application
- Basic troubleshooting

**Success criteria**: âœ… Your app is accessible at `http://my-first-app.dev.idp.local`

#### Module 2: Configuration Management (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand how to manage configurations across environments

```yaml
# You'll learn to manage environment-specific configs
apiVersion: platform.idp/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: my-app-config
spec:
  environments:
    development:
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        cpu: '100m'
        memory: '128Mi'
    production:
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        cpu: '500m'
        memory: '512Mi'
```

**What you'll learn**:

- Environment-specific configuration patterns
- How to use the Backstage configuration UI
- Configuration validation and rollback
- Hot configuration reloading

**Success criteria**: âœ… Same app running with different configs in dev vs staging

#### Module 3: Monitoring and Observability (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand how to monitor your applications

**What you'll learn**:

- Reading Grafana dashboards
- Understanding application metrics
- Setting up alerts
- Using distributed tracing

**Success criteria**: âœ… You can see your app's metrics and traces in Grafana

#### Module 4: CI/CD Integration (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Connect your code repository to automated deployments

**What you'll learn**:

- Git workflow integration
- Argo Workflows for CI/CD
- Branch-based deployments
- Promotion between environments

**Success criteria**: âœ… Code push triggers automatic deployment

### ðŸŽ“ Skill Assessments

Quick checkpoints to validate your learning:

#### Checkpoint 1: Basic Platform Usage

```bash
# Can you deploy an application?
idp-cli create my-test-app nginx:latest development

# Can you check its status?
kubectl get webapplications my-test-app

# Can you access it?
curl http://my-test-app.dev.idp.local
```

#### Checkpoint 2: Configuration Management

```bash
# Can you update configuration without redeployment?
idp-cli config update my-test-app --replicas 3

# Can you roll back if needed?
idp-cli config rollback my-test-app --to-version previous
```

#### Checkpoint 3: Troubleshooting

```bash
# Can you diagnose issues?
idp-cli debug my-test-app

# Can you check logs?
idp-cli logs my-test-app --follow

# Can you check service mesh status?
istioctl analyze -n my-test-app
```
