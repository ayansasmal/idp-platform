# Integrated Developer Platform (IDP) Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the complete architecture and implementation of a production-ready Kubernetes-based Integrated Developer Platform (IDP) designed primarily for web applications with future extensibility for IoT projects.

**Current Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY** - All 6 phases completed with automation scripts and comprehensive observability.

## Architecture Components

### Core Infrastructure Stack

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform
- **Crossplane**: Infrastructure as Code and multi-cloud management
- **Istio/Envoy**: Service mesh for traffic management, security, and observability
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based continuous deployment
- **LocalStack**: Local AWS service emulation for development

### Container Registry

- **AWS ECR**: Production container registry
- **LocalStack ECR**: Local development container registry
- Unified workflow across environments

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous Integration (build, test, security scans)
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based Continuous Deployment
- **Container Build**: Multi-stage Docker builds pushed to ECR

### Secrets Management

- **External Secrets Operator (ESO)**: Kubernetes secrets synchronization
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Production secrets backend
- **LocalStack Secrets**: Local development secrets
- **cert-manager**: Certificate lifecycle management
- **Istio mTLS**: Service-to-service encryption

### Developer Experience

- **Backstage**: Developer portal and service catalog
- **Custom CRDs**: Platform abstractions (WebApplication, etc.)
- **Software Templates**: Self-service application scaffolding
- **Multi-environment**: Seamless local to production workflows

## Platform Abstractions

### WebApplication CRD

High-level abstraction that generates:

- Kubernetes Deployment manifests
- Service definitions
- Istio VirtualService/Gateway configurations
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler settings
- Crossplane resource claims (databases, storage)

### Environment Strategy

- **Local Development**: LocalStack + Kind/Minikube
- **Staging**: AWS with reduced resources
- **Production**: Full AWS infrastructure
- **GitOps**: Same configurations, different targets

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/idp-platform.git
cd idp-platform

# 2. One-time setup
./scripts/dev-setup.sh

# 3. Start platform
./scripts/quick-start.sh

# That's it! Platform is running with all services accessible
```

### Access Your Platform

All services are automatically accessible:
- **ArgoCD**: http://localhost:8080 (admin / [get password])
- **Backstage**: http://localhost:3000 (Developer portal)
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin / admin)
- **Complete monitoring stack**: All auto-forwarded

The platform is now production-ready with comprehensive automation! ðŸŽ‰
