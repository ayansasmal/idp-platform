# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a production-ready Kubernetes-based Integrated Developer Platform (IDP) designed for web applications with future IoT extensibility. The platform implements GitOps principles with comprehensive automation, service mesh, and developer self-service capabilities.

**Current Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY** - All core phases completed with advanced multi-instance capabilities and comprehensive automation.

## Repository Structure

**Two Independent GitHub Repositories:**
- **[idp-platform](https://github.com/ayansasmal/idp-platform)** - Core platform infrastructure, GitOps configurations, scripts
- **[idp-backstage-app](https://github.com/ayansasmal/idp-backstage-app)** - Backstage developer portal application

## Quick Platform Setup

```bash
# Clone and start the platform (one command!)
git clone https://github.com/ayansasmal/idp-platform.git
cd idp-platform
./scripts/idp.sh setup
# Platform automatically handles Backstage integration
```

## Development Policies

- Always update claude.md with any changes to the state, structure, features, functionalities of the IDP

## Common Development Commands

### Platform Management
```bash
# Platform setup and configuration
./scripts/idp-setup-wizard.sh       # Interactive setup wizard for platform configuration
./scripts/config-parser.sh show     # Display current platform configuration
./scripts/config-parser.sh validate # Validate platform configuration

# Start entire platform (primary command) - now includes configuration check
./scripts/idp.sh setup

# Platform lifecycle management  
./scripts/idp.sh start               # Start all services with port-forwards

## Architecture Components

### Core Infrastructure Stack

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration (Docker Desktop/Kind/Minikube)
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based continuous deployment at localhost:8080
- **Backstage**: Developer portal and service catalog at localhost:3000
- **Istio**: Service mesh for traffic management, security (mTLS), observability
- **External LocalStack**: AWS service emulation (Cognito, ECR, RDS, Secrets Manager)
- **Crossplane**: Infrastructure as Code with hybrid LocalStack/AWS providers
- **External Secrets Operator**: Kubernetes secrets management
- **Argo Workflows**: Kubernetes-native CI for container builds

### Platform Abstractions
The platform's primary abstraction is the **WebApplication CRD** (`platform/crds/webapplication-crd.yaml`) which automatically generates:
- Kubernetes Deployments and Services
- Istio VirtualService and Gateway configurations  
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler settings
- Crossplane resource claims (databases, storage)

### Multi-Instance Architecture (NEW)
- **IDPInstance CRD**: Manages multiple environment instances (dev/staging/prod)
- **InstancePromotion CRD**: Handles cross-environment deployments with validation
- **Instance Controller**: Automated lifecycle management and health monitoring
- **Cross-Instance Communication**: Service discovery and secrets synchronization

### Directory Structure
- `applications/`: ArgoCD applications and GitOps configurations
- `infrastructure/`: Core platform infrastructure (Istio, auth, etc.)
- `platform/`: Custom CRDs, operators, workflows, and backend services
- `platform/multi-instance/`: Multi-instance management components (NEW)
- `scripts/`: Automation scripts for platform lifecycle management
- `docs/`: Comprehensive architecture and implementation documentation

### External Repositories
- `../idp-backstage-app/`: Separate Backstage application repository (TypeScript/Node.js)
  - Automatically cloned and integrated by platform scripts
  - Independent development and versioning
  - Built and deployed via platform automation

### Environment Strategy
- **Local Development**: LocalStack + Kubernetes (Docker Desktop/Kind)
- **Staging**: AWS with reduced resources
- **Production**: Full AWS infrastructure
- **Multi-Instance**: Automated promotion workflows between environments
- **Consistency**: Same GitOps configurations across all environments

### Authentication & Security
- **AWS Cognito**: Centralized OAuth/OIDC authentication for all services
- **Test Accounts**: admin/TempPassword123!, developer/TempPassword123!
- **Istio mTLS**: Service-to-service encryption
- **JWT Validation**: Token-based API security
- **cert-manager**: Automatic certificate lifecycle management

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/idp-platform.git
cd idp-platform

# 2. One-time setup and start
./scripts/idp.sh setup

# 3. Start platform services
./scripts/idp.sh start

# That's it! Complete platform is running with all services accessible
```

### Access Your Platform

All services are automatically accessible:
- **ArgoCD**: https://localhost:8080 (admin / [get password from output])
- **Backstage**: http://localhost:3000 (Developer portal)
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin / admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090 (Metrics collection)
- **Jaeger**: http://localhost:16686 (Distributed tracing)
- **Kiali**: http://localhost:20001 (Service mesh observability)
- **Argo Workflows**: http://localhost:4000 (CI/CD workflows)
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: http://localhost:3002 (Observability overview)

The platform is now production-ready with comprehensive automation! ðŸŽ‰

## âš¡ Latest Optimizations (Script Simplification & Efficiency)

### Unified Platform Management
```bash
# New streamlined workflow (all-in-one script)
./scripts/idp.sh setup           # One-time platform setup (replaces multiple scripts)
./scripts/idp.sh build-backstage # Build Backstage via internal Argo Workflows
./scripts/idp.sh start           # Start all services with intelligent discovery
./scripts/idp.sh stop            # Stop all services
./scripts/idp.sh restart         # Restart platform services
./scripts/idp.sh status          # Check platform status
./scripts/idp.sh config          # Run configuration wizard
```

### Key Optimizations Implemented
- **14 scripts â†’ 1 unified script** with specialized functions
- **External builds â†’ Internal workflows** using Argo Workflows  
- **Manual coordination â†’ Automated orchestration**
- **Reduced complexity â†’ Streamlined developer experience**

### Script Changes Summary
- **Created**: `scripts/idp.sh` - Unified platform management script
- **Created**: `platform/workflows/backstage-ci-pipeline.yaml` - Internal CI/CD for Backstage
- **Simplified**: `scripts/quick-start.sh` - Now wrapper to unified script
- **Documented**: `scripts/DEPRECATED_SCRIPTS.md` - Migration guide for deprecated scripts
- **Enhanced**: README.md and documentation to reflect new simplified workflow

### Backstage Build Process (Now Internal)
1. **Setup Platform**: `./scripts/idp.sh setup` deploys ArgoCD + Argo Workflows
2. **Trigger Build**: `./scripts/idp.sh build-backstage` submits workflow to internal CI/CD  
3. **Automated Pipeline**: Argo Workflows clones, builds, containerizes, and deploys Backstage
4. **GitOps Integration**: ArgoCD automatically syncs and deploys to platform
5. **Access**: Backstage available at http://localhost:3000 via intelligent port-forwarding

**Result**: Complete end-to-end automation with simplified developer interface!
